1. whereas shuffle is necessary for neural network, it has nothing to do with decision tree, so as for ensemble methods such as random forests and boosts
2. data shuffle is critical for neural network as well due to sequential nature of neural networks with respect to batch logic
3. it is critical to arrange batch size parallel to data variance of most important parameter since it effects update of weights efficiently
4. for this, neural network is much more suitable since it is able to generalize more, tree is greedy, especially consider out of range or alternative data
5. shuffle delusion for CARTs
6. Regression tree is not suitable that much since target is not categorical or binary, it is continuous value. Then it is not productive at all
7. future research 1, effects of data variance comparison to entire possible combinations with low variance
8. future research 2, inconsistency of theory and practice, possibly, really Re is more important
